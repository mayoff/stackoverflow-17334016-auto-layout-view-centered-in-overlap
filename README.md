This project demonstrates how to use Cocoa auto layout to keep a “middle” view centered in the vertical overlap between two other views.

[This stack overflow Q&A](http://stackoverflow.com/q/17334016/77567) explains the desired behavior and how this project implements it.

This project is hereby placed in the public domain.
